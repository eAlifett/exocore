<p><strong>1. Join Github</strong></p>

<p>If you don’t have a Github account, <a href="https://github.com/join">create one here</a>. Git provides the ability to edit your project locally, and push it to the web to be deployed as a website.</p>

<p>Launch your Exocore instance on Netlify in a few minutes by clicking <a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/hot-domme/exocore">here</a>. Netlify offers free hosting for your Exocore, and builds your site server-side with Jekyll.
