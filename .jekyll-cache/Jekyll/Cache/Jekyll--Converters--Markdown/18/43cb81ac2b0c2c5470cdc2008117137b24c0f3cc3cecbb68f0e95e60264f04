<p>The Exocore is an easily navigable personal hypertext database for text and images— a personal wiki which, over time, forms in increasingly faithful digital representation of your brain. Read a more detailed explanation of the Exocore’s present and future functionality <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/exocore/">here.</a></p>

<h3 id="sections">Sections</h3>
<p>The text-based element of the Exocore is split into four sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Articles</li>
  <li>Journal</li>
  <li>Notes</li>
  <li>Daily Note</li>
</ul>

<p>Each section has a discrete <strong>index</strong>, which you can find in the sidebar on the left if you are reading this in a browser. You will also see an <strong>Archive</strong> section, which includes posts from all sections except daily notes, meant to act as a scratch pad/research dump to furnish more developed notes. Lastly, the <strong>Latest Posts</strong> section shows your 10 latest posts from any category in a continuous scroll, with the titles of each post linking back to the post as a standalone page. On the standalone page you can find <strong>related posts</strong> and a <strong>tags</strong> section. These sections are generated from the tags you add into the metadata section of any given post you make. You can read more about metadata <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/start-here/#using-metadata">below</a>.</p>

<h3 id="creating-new-posts">Creating new posts</h3>

<p>Use keyboard command `Ctrl + Shift + P’ to summon the command panel. From here you can access a variety of functions by beginning to type their names. Start typing ‘create new note from template’ to find the options for creating new posts.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Daily Notes</strong> are designed as a quick access scratch pad, and are perfect for low-specificity research dumps and fleeting notes that will inform your notes in future. These are automatically titled by date. One is created each day automatically, and opened when you open VSCode.</li>
  <li><strong>Wiki Notes</strong> are designed for single atomic data points, and are automatically titled with a hexadecimal color code. This code is turned into a correspondingly colored badge in the index of the published site.</li>
  <li><strong>Journal Entries</strong> are for your thoughts, and are not automatically titled.</li>
  <li><strong>Articles</strong> are for longer write-ups on a particular topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may have noticed that these notes together create a pipeline for systematising knowledge over time from the general to the particular, and for capturing a bank of scattered reference material and developing it into a polished final product. An example of how a Daily note might be</p>

<h2 id="using-metadata">Using Metadata</h2>

<p>When you create a new post of any category, it will be spawned with a metadata section at the top, which affects how the post will be treated when your Exocore is rendered into a website. The metadata of the post you are currently reading looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: article
category: article
subtitle:
topic: meta
date: 2022-04-13
tags: meta computers exocore
---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’re using a browser to read this, you won’t see this information at the top of the post, but the Exocore has incorporated it already into the way it treats the post. It has dated the post, sorted it into the ‘Articles’ section of the site, and given it tags which appear in the left sidebar.</p>
