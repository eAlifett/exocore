<h3 id="appendix-using-git-for-the-first-time">Appendix: Using Git for the first time</h3>
<p>Git is a version management software which allows you to synchronise a project in multiple places at once. For the purposes of the Exocore, it is a way to edit your project locally, and push it to the web to be deployed as a website.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://github.com/join">signing up with Github</a> and following the instructions after clicking â€˜Use this templateâ€™, the easiest way to get the repository onto your device locally is to use the Github GUI. You can also use the command line tool, but the GUI is friendlier for new users. You can download it <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Open the program and follow the instructions to sign in to your Github account, then find your repository and click â€˜clone (your-username/repository-name)â€™. Select a place you want the repository to live (such as your desktop) and click â€˜Cloneâ€™. This downloads a copy of your Exocore onto your machine so that your changes will by synchronized.</p>
