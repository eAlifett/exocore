# Technical Principles

### Fast and Lightweight
**Fast:**
- Loading time
- Open time
- Latency time
- Connection time

Achieved with simple, uncomplex UI and opinionated, focused functionality.

### Always Open
Lightweight enough to remain open on your desktop at all times without hogging processing power.

### Space-efficient unobtrusive, and responsive UI
Tiled chats that fluidly grow, shrink and redistribute in grid format in response to the space allowed by window size. Accommodates for a strip across the top of your screen, or along the side, or a full screen on an extra monitor. Rearrange tiles for priority, control sound and alerts independently, and pop chats out into a separate window.
