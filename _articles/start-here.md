## What is the Exocore?
The Exocore is an easily navigable personal hypertext database for text and imagesâ€” a personal wiki which, over time, forms in increasingly faithful digital representation of your brain. Read a more detailed explanation of the Exocore's present and future functionality [[exocore|here.]]

[[installation-instructions]]

### Sections
The text-based element of the Exocore is split into four sections:
- Articles
- Journal
- Notes
- Daily Note

 Each section has a discrete **index**, which you can find in the sidebar on the left if you are reading this in a browser. You will also see an **Archive** section, which includes posts from all sections except daily notes, meant to act as a scratch pad/research dump to furnish more developed notes. Lastly, the **Latest Posts** section shows your 10 latest posts from any category in a continuous scroll, with the titles of each post linking back to the post as a standalone page. On the standalone page you can find **related posts** and a **tags** section. These sections are generated from the tags you add into the metadata section of any given post you make. You can read more about metadata [[start-here#Using Metadata|below]]. 

## Features
**Smart syntax rendering:** To read more about how you can use hyperlinks, embedded code, footnotes and more, see [[syntax|this article]] about Exocore syntax.

## Using Metadata

When you create a new post of any category, it will be spawned with a metadata section at the top, which affects how the post will be treated when your Exocore is rendered into a website. The metadata of the post you are currently reading looks like this:

```
---
layout: article
category: article
subtitle:
topic: meta
date: 2022-04-13
tags: meta computers exocore
---
```

If you're using a browser to read this, you won't see this information at the top of the post, but the Exocore has incorporated it already into the way it treats the post. It has dated the post, sorted it into the 'Articles' section of the site, and given it tags which appear in the left sidebar.
